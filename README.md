angular
=======

Learning angularjs beyond fiddling, typically with node.js and express

todo - starting with the angular todo sample, add updates and deletes,
       then persistence in mongodb through a node.js/express back end.
       (Note: index.html, todo.js, todo-app.js are newer than
       index2.html, todo2.js, todo-app2.js)
